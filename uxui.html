        Context: 
      </h4>
      <p>
        Urban areas around the world are struggling with the issue of stray and abandoned animals. This
        problem poses major challenges to public health, safety, and efforts to create sustainable cities.
        Shelters and community organizations are overwhelmed and have difficulty promoting
        responsible pet adoptions. 
      </p>
      <h4>Problems:</h4>
      <p>
        - Many potential adopters harbor misconceptions about the health and behavior of shelter
        animals. Societal preferences for specific breeds also limits the chances of adoption from shelters.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Potential adopters often feel uncertain about the adoption process and the responsibilities
        of pet ownership. New pet owners frequently encounter challenges without adequate support, leading to
        potential abandonment or neglect of the pet.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Shelters operate with limited resources, making it difficult to provide extensive support and
        information to adopters

      <h4>Usability Testing Results:</h4>
      <p>
        After gathering recommendations from the testers during the usability testing and feedback phase, 
        the most important task was to implement more intuitive navigational tools for UAdopt. I adjusted the design to be 
        more “pet friendly” since the old design was pretty bland and did not relate as well to our 
        context/problems as one of the testers pointed out. Another alteration was adding a social media option. This way, 
        pet owners could have a community where they can feel free to ask the professionals and each other for advice with concerning their pets.
